	<h1> Lip oils </h1>
	<p> Here are some of the cutest lip oils that I personally like. I hope you enjoy!</p>
	<br>
	<h4>3. Kaja Juicy Glass Lip Oil</h4>
	    <img src= "s2709186-main-zoom.webp" width= "500" height= "500">
		<p> This lip oil is priced at 18 dollars, and there are five shades ranging from red to purple. The packaging is rather simple, but the heart on the inside of the cap is quite cute. You are able to get the lipstick at Sephora, Nordstrom, Kohl's, and the Kaja website. 

	<h4> 2. Gisou Honey Infused Hydrating Lip Oil</h4>
	    <img src= "s2683464-main-zoom.jpg" width= "500" height= "500">
		<p> This lip oil is priced higher at 28 dollars, and there are four shades ranging from a sparkly pink to a pretty orange. The packaging is rather simple, but the pink cap is quite cute. You are able to get the lipstick at Sephora and the Gisou website. 
	<h4> 1. Dior Lip Glow Oil</h4>
	    <img src= "s2316172-main-zoom.webp" width= "500" height= "500">
		<p> This lip oil is really pricey at 40 dollars, and there are eleven shades ranging from a clear to a lavender. The packaging is rather simple, but it feels rather sophisticated. You are able to get the lipstick at Sephora, Ulta Beauty, and the Dior website.
