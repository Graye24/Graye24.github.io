		<p> This blush is a little more expensive; it is priced at 29 dollars at Sephora. It is a powder blush and leaves a more subtle finish, but the packaging is very cute. There are 6 colors ranging from peach to fuchsia, and you are able to get this at Sephora, Ulta, and Walmart.

		<p> Priced only at twelve dollars, this a really cute cheap blush. There is a very cute selection of colors, and it was heart shaped. Who doesn't love heart shaped products? I recently bought this myself and I love it. You are able to get this at the ColourPop website.
